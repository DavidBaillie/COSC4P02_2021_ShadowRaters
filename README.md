## Introduction
In a world of ever-growing technological literacy, the ability for a potential student to determine the best institution for them and their future endeavors is critical.
Currently, the best option for students comes in the form of a website called Rate My Professor. Using this resource, students can see the general opinion of professors 
at a school, or the general opinion of a school. Our aim is to develop a better tool for students to use when looking to determine the quality of an available education,
quality of professors, and how the experience will change as they move through their education.

## The problem
Currently the best resource for students can inform them about a single professor, or a single school at a time. While this is useful, the utility of this 
information is heavily limited by the context of the class and professor. For example, while one can see the rating of a professor, there is no way 
to tell if the professors’ abilities differ between the courses they teach.

## The objective
In order to deliver better experience for students and educators, our service aims to provide better information about student perceptions of professors, 
classes, departments, and schools. When students use the service to provide feedback, they will have the ability to rate the class by term, the professor 
in the class, and department at the time. In turn when viewing ratings about the school, users will be able to see how a professor rates over time, 
how professors’ rate by class, how classes have rated over time, and many more views. With all the information available, prospective students will 
have a complete view of the institution they are potentially attending, and the quality of educators at the institution. Additionally, this information 
can be used by staff at the institution to measure the perceived quality over time. 

## Methodology
To develop this service, we will be using an Agile based SCRUM method broken into two-week sprints. Each sprint will be used as a phase of development
to either expand feature sets or to refine current systems.

## Weekly meeting time
The team will meet every Wednesday at 5pm on Microsoft Teams for an estimated meeting duration of 60min.
