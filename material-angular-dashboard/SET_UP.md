1. Open your copied repo folder in terminal and install necessary modules with command, make sure that you have installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm):

npm install

2. Install [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) globally to use its commands in the terminal:

npm install --global @angular/cli

3. Now you are able to run or build the project:

Run `npm start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run build` or `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
